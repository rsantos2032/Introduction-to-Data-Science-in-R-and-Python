### Question 1: Answer all these questions using the babynames data set from the babynames package in R.

```{r}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)

nam <- babynames %>% distinct(name)  %>% pull(name) %>% unique() %>% str_to_lower()
```

#### a. Find all the babynames that are exactly 4 letters long, begin with two vowels (a, e, i , o, u) , and end in the letter y. How many are there?

```{r}
str_view(nam, "^[aeiou]{2}.y$")
length(str_view(nam, "^[aeiou]{2}.y$"))
```

#### b. Find all the babynames that begin and end with the letter g. How many are there?

```{r}
str_view(nam, "^g.*.g$")
length(str_view(nam, "^g.*.g$"))
```
